## Raspberry Pi Side of Koalby/Ava

### Install and Use
1. Download and install the latest versions of CoppeliaSim, Git, and Python for your OS
    1. CoppeliaSim: https://coppeliarobotics.com/
    2. Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads/
    3. Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Clone this GitHub repository
    1. https://github.com/KoalbyMQP/RaspberryPi-Code_23-24
3. Switch to the dev branch of this repository
4. Install all Python packages in requirements.txt found in the root folder of this repository
    1. pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Open CoppeliaSim
    1. For Ubuntu and macOS, you may have to open CoppeliaSim through terminal if not working
6. Open wanted scene in CoppeliaSim
    1. Our scenes are located at RaspberryPi-Code_23-24/backend/KoalbyHumanoid/Simulation Files
    2. In CoppeliaSim: File → Open scene... → (select the scene file) → Open
7. Run the Python script corresponding to what you want to happen in the scene
    1. Our demo scripts are located at RaspberryPi-Code_23-24/backend/Demo Scripts
    2. Make sure to run any scripts locally and from the root folder of this repository
